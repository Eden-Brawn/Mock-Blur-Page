      <p id="tribute-info">Blur are a rock band originating from London, England. Originally called Seymour, they were recruited by the label, Food Records where they changed there name.</p>
      <p id="tribute-info">They went on to release three singles in 1990, and of those three There's No Other Way did well enough that it put them on the map. 1991, they released their first album, Leisure, which was a success but recieved negative reviews.</p>
      <p id="tribute-info">In 1992 they toured America where they begun feeling homesick for Britain. Once they returned to Britain they were at risk of being dropped by food records. In response to this they decided to draw on there love for England, specifically London, and create their second album, Modren Life Is Rubbish. This released in 1993 and did well in England but poorly in America.</p>
      <p id="tribute-info">In 1994 Blur released there defining album, Parklife. It charted very well and made Blur a huge Britpop band.</p>
      <p id="tribute-info">The following year, 1995, they released there fourth album, The Great Escape. Which reviewed and sold incredibly well. During the lead up to the release Blur and Oasis released singles on the same day, Blur outsold Oasis. But in the long run Oasis's album far out sold The Great Escape.</p>
