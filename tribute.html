        <p class="tribute-info">Blur are a rock band originating from London, England. Originally called Seymour, they were recruited by the label, Food Records where they changed there name.</p>
        <p class="tribute-info">They went on to release three singles in 1990, and of those three There's No Other Way did well enough that it put them on the map. 1991, they released their first album, Leisure, which was a success but recieved negative reviews.</p>
        <p class="tribute-info">In 1992 they toured America where they begun feeling homesick for Britain. Once they returned to Britain they were at risk of being dropped by food records. In response to this they decided to draw on there love for England, specifically London, and create their second album, Modren Life Is Rubbish. This released in 1993 and did well in England but poorly in America.</p>
        <p class="tribute-info">In 1994 Blur released there defining album, Parklife. It charted very well and made Blur a huge Britpop band.</p>
        <p class="tribute-info">The following year, 1995, they released there fourth album, The Great Escape. Which reviewed and sold incredibly well. During the lead up to the release Blur and Oasis released singles on the same day, Blur outsold Oasis. But in the long run Oasis's album far out sold The Great Escape.</p>
        <p class="tribute-info">
          This time period led to alot of tension between the band members and they began feeling resentment towards the Britpop sound. This led to there 1997 self titled album blur. While this album was not as popular in Britain as there previous work, it was much more successful abroad than those albums.
        </p>
        <p class="tribute-info">
          There 1999 album 13 saw them move even further away from the Britpop period. Also this album being lyrically inspired by Damon Alburn's breakup, this led to a much more serious album compared to there previous work. The album performed well and reviewed well but not as good as there previous work.
        </p>
        <p class="tribute-info">
          Tension between members continued to get worse, this led to Graham Coxon leaving during the recording for their next album in 2002. In 2003 Think Tank was released, this album performed and reviewed well.
        </p>
        <p class="tribute-info">
          In the following years, the band did not perform live or release new music. This was the first hiatus where the remaining band members did not have much communication. In 2007 they announced that all four of them had privately united. 
        </p>
        <p class="tribute-info">
          In 2009 the band announced a reunion concert at Hyde Park. This led to a string of perfomances. In 2015 they released the The Magic Whip, an album inspired by Hong Kong, it did very well. They then went on there second hiatus.
        </p>
        <p class="tribute-info">
          In 2023 Blur reunited again and produced a new album, The Ballad of Darren, the album had a great reception. Coinciding with this they announced a huge Wembly Stadium concert. The last announcement from Blur was in 2024 where they released a documentry called To The End.
